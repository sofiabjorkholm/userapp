Create two more routes:
- route 2: renders a page that displays a form which is your search bar. 
(browser rendering engine.) 
(Software that renders HTML pages (Web pages). )
(It turns the HTML layout tags in the page into the appropriate commands for the operating system,
 which causes the formation of the text characters and images for screen and printer.)
- route 3: takes in the post request from your form, 
- then displays matching users on a new page. 
- Users should be matched based on whether either their first or 
- last name contains the input string. %>

Create two more routes:
- route 4: renders a page with three inputs on it (first name, last name, and email) 
that allows you to add new users to the users.json file.
- route 5: takes in the post request from the 'create user' form, 
then adds the user to the users.json file. Once that is complete, 
redirects to the route that displays all your users (from part 0).
